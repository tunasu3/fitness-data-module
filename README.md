“A module to analyze personal fitness data”

Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project aims to develop a data analysis and visualization module for fitness tracking.
The goal is to collect personal fitness data (such as daily steps, calories burned, workout duration, and sleep hours) and perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights about activity patterns and health trends. Later, machine learning methods will be applied to predict or classify patterns in the data.

Project Goal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 By tracking daily fitness metrics, this project aims to:

-Understand personal activity patterns

-Identify factors affecting performance and wellness

-Provide insights to improve fitness habits and routines

Key Research Questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.How do daily and weekly patterns affect my fitness metrics?

2.What is the relationship between sleep, workout duration, and calories burned?

3.Can step count trends predict workout performance?

Dataset
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset will be self-collected starting from this week and stored in Excel. Each row will represent a day, including:

Date: Date of record

Steps Count: Number of steps taken

Workout Duration: Minutes of exercise

Calories Burned: Estimated calories

Sleep Duration: Hours slept

Primary Data Collection
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset will be built using personal fitness tracking sources:

1.Wearable device or smartphone app – daily steps, heart rate, calories burned, etc.

2.Workout logs – duration, type, and intensity of exercises

3.Sleep tracker – hours of sleep and sleep quality

Data Structure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset will include the following variables:

Date: The exact date of the record

Steps Count: Number of steps taken

Workout Duration: Duration of exercise in minutes

Workout Type: Type of exercise (e.g., cardio, strength, yoga)

Calories Burned: Estimated calories burned during the day

Sleep Duration: Total hours of sleep

Sleep Quality: Rating of sleep quality
